# DNA–Microtubule Network Simulation

This repository contains the simulation code used for the study:
> "Dynamic assembly of complex hierarchical DNA polymer networks by biomolecular active agents"

The code implements a coarse-grained polymer model of DNA–microtubule systems using FENE and Lennard–Jones potentials,
with self-propulsion applied to mimic gliding motion of microtubules. The system is simulated in 2D with periodic boundary conditions.

## Features
- **Polymer model**: FENE(Finite Extensible Non-linear Elastic) + Lennard–Jones potentials
- **Self-propulsion**: Applied to end monomer with defined polarity
- **Periodic boundary conditions** in 2D
- **Example configuration** provided for test runs
